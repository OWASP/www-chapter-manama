## Code of Conduct

OWASP Manama meetings and events are an inclusive environment where all people should feel safe and respected. We welcome diversity in age, race, ethnicity, national origin, range of abilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, financial means, education, and political perspective.

OWASP Manama will not tolerate any form of violence, harassment, hate speech or trolling either off or online, or any overly drunken, intimidating or heckling behaviour.

Please respect the presenters, donâ€™t talk amongst yourselves during their presentations and ensure your mobile phones are muted or switched off.

We want you to have fun, in a safe and respectful environment.

If you have any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct please contact one or the Chapter Leads either in person, though the Meetup page or via email.
